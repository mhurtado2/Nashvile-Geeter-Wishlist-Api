In those days there seemed to be countless overdrives on the market that had what we describe as the ‘nasal’ tone but we worked hard on creating a very ‘open’ sounding pedal that worked with you and your amplifier. The result was the ODR-1, the pedal that responds to your dynamics and adds texture to your tone in a very natural, musical way",

The preamp and 2-band EQ section are voiced perfectly for running your gain pedals in front of the amp, while still maintaining Supro’s signature midrange heft and phenomenal touch dynamics. And a transparent effects loop provides the ideal point to inject your delay and reverb effects into the amplifier’s all-tube signal path, avoiding unwanted distortion on modulation effects. The Keeley Custom 12 features the legendary Celestion G12M-65 Creamback speaker, developed in the mid 1960s and beloved by the biggest guitar players in history. It produces vintage, woody tone while still offering major power, perfect for modern amps. Low-end heft complements warm and vocal mid-range, with crunchy upper-mids and sweet, articulate highs. A master volume circuit allows you to control the sound pressure level coming from the speaker, while pouring on copious amounts of gain from the ECC83S-based tube preamp or your favorite dirt pedals.",

Fan bracing, which is commonly used in classical guitars, allows the TOD10N to produce a warm and natural nylon-string sound. The top is made of solid Sitka spruce, which delivers a broad frequency range from shimmering highs to tight mids and a full-bodied low end. The walnut fingerboard features a well-balanced tonal character, and is topped with a Tree of Death inlay—a nod to the classic Ibanez Tree of Life design, but with a twist.",

      "description": "The MONO M80 dual-guitar gig bag solves the hassle of traveling with two guitars. MONO's elegant solution, the M80, offers each of your instruments the same protection that separate cases would. You often have two instruments handy at gigs, in the studio, or on tour. Now you can bring 'em both, hassle free. The M80's innovative design creates, essentially, a separate case for each guitar - and it also works great if you're only packin' one guitar. Next time you have to travel with two guitars, grab the one case you need: the MONO M80!",

The aptly named Freeze sound-retainer pedal lets you play a note or a chord, hit the pedal, and freeze that sound in sustained place, indefinitely. You can choose between fast or slow decay to let the sound fade out. Or choose the Latch function and let the sound continuously sustain for as long as you like. Best of all, once you've captured a sustained sound, you can continue to play over it. It's an amazing self-accompaniment tool! Freeze also lets you dial in exactly the amount of effect you want, so it's perfect for a wide range of applications.",

Rather than putting your tone in a stompbox you can turn on and off, the EBow puts the control right into your own hands - your picking hands, to be specific. This handheld wonder vibrates your guitar strings, making way for unbelievable sonic effects such as infinite sustain, bowing sounds, slurs, fades, and more. Try it with a distortion pedal and a delay pedal, and you won't believe the textures coming out of your guitar rig. Loop the tone and soar a lead over the top - the possibilities are endless. If you've been dry on song ideas and want to give your creativity a kickstart, don't spend a fortune - start with the amazing EBow.",
