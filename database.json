We have worked very hard to give you, the musician exactly what you wanted – the Original ODR-1 that has developed its own almost cult following since we originally designed and engineered it way back in 1985. In those days there seemed to be countless overdrives on the market that had what we describe as the ‘nasal’ tone but we worked hard on creating a very ‘open’ sounding pedal that worked with you and your amplifier. The result was the ODR-1, the pedal that responds to your dynamics and adds texture to your tone in a very natural, musical way",

We spent months locked up in the Strymon sound design labs dreaming up the most spacious, lush, creative, and tweakable delay effects ever heard. It was a monumental task—a relentless study of delays and their nuances, and a continuous pursuit of innovative and musically inspirational sounds. Utilizing a ridiculously powerful SHARC DSP, every drop of processing power is harnessed.",

This magical combination is by no means ideal - the challenge to achieve a consistent sound from the practice room to the studio, and especially to the stage, continues to frustrate guitarists, just as it has since the early 1940s.",

      "description": "Designed in collaboration with Robert Keeley of Keeley Electronics as a follow-up to the bestselling Custom 10, the Keeley Custom 12 is built to seamlessly integrate your pedals into the heart of an all-tube Supro amplifier. The preamp and 2-band EQ section are voiced perfectly for running your gain pedals in front of the amp, while still maintaining Supro’s signature midrange heft and phenomenal touch dynamics. And a transparent effects loop provides the ideal point to inject your delay and reverb effects into the amplifier’s all-tube signal path, avoiding unwanted distortion on modulation effects. The Keeley Custom 12 features the legendary Celestion G12M-65 Creamback speaker, developed in the mid 1960s and beloved by the biggest guitar players in history. It produces vintage, woody tone while still offering major power, perfect for modern amps. Low-end heft complements warm and vocal mid-range, with crunchy upper-mids and sweet, articulate highs. A master volume circuit allows you to control the sound pressure level coming from the speaker, while pouring on copious amounts of gain from the ECC83S-based tube preamp or your favorite dirt pedals.",

Its thin, compact body and enhanced access to the upper frets contribute to its excellent playability. The modified FR hollowbody design has no soundhole on the body top, resulting in less feedback. Fan bracing, which is commonly used in classical guitars, allows the TOD10N to produce a warm and natural nylon-string sound. The top is made of solid Sitka spruce, which delivers a broad frequency range from shimmering highs to tight mids and a full-bodied low end. The walnut fingerboard features a well-balanced tonal character, and is topped with a Tree of Death inlay—a nod to the classic Ibanez Tree of Life design, but with a twist.",
